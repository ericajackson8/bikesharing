# Bikesharing Challanges
## Bike Trip Analysis NYC
### Overview
We have been tasked with analyzing the Bike Sharing U?sage Data for New York City.  We are trying to determin if beginning a similar Program in Des Moines is worthwhile.  
### Results
We were able to analyze several aspects of the NYC Bike Sharing Data.  We were most interested in The Duration of Trips, The Peak & Off-Peak Times for Bike Checkouts, Usage by User Type and Gender
#### Duration of Trips
1. Most bike users checkout bikes for less that 20 minutes.
2. Males account for the majority of bike users overall, and the majority of bike users that checkout bikes for less than 20 minutes.

#### Bike Usage by Time of Day
1. Peak morning usage is between the hours of 8 - 9 am, everyday of the week.  Thursday appears to be the Peak Day for even during the 8-9 am, and 5-7pm hours, there is an increase in usage.
2. Peak evening usage is from 5-7pm on most days except Wednesday.

#### Bike usage by User Type and Gender
